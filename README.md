Git Repo for Grammar Error Correction

This repository contains the files that were used to create models that can be used to do grammar error correction.

We attempt to solve the problem using various techniques and models, which are stored in the model_notebooks folder.

We also have done exploratory data analysis of the training data available.

To setup:
1. Download the data files, especially the wi+locness dataset from [https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/).
2. Have Python 3.10 and above installed
3. Install jupyter: `pip install jupyter`
4. Start the jupyter server, e.g.: `python -m notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --port 8888`
